ðŸ‘‹ Hi there,

I'm a software engineer living and working in Copenhagen, mainly focused on building enterprise applications that are scalable, reliable, and cloud-ready.

I primarily work with Java and the Spring Boot framework â€” technologies I love for their robustness and flexibility. I'm passionate about microservices architecture, cloud infrastructure, and designing systems that can evolve with real-world needs.

I'm also deeply interested in Artificial Intelligence, especially how Large Language Models (LLMs) and agent-based services are transforming the software landscape. I enjoy exploring how these tools can be used in real-world applications.

## ðŸ›  What This Page Is About

This GitHub page is where I share my personal projects, proof-of-concepts, and experiments â€” many of which I use to:

- Explore new technologies in-depth
- Prepare for real-world implementation
- Support talks, conferences, and writing I'm involved in

It's my sandbox for learning, building, and testing ideas â€” and I hope you find something here that inspires you too.
